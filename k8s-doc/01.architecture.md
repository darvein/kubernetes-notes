# Kubernetes Architecture

## Kubernetes Components
### Master:
Components:
- API Server
- Cloud Controller (optional)
- Controller Manager
- Etcd
- Scheduler

### Nodes:
Components:
- Kubelet
- Kube-proxy

This is where workloads are deployed and run.

Nodes have:
- Status
- Heartbeats
- Node Controller (on control plane)
- Eviction Limits (?)
- Node topology
- Graceful node shutdown

Kubelete and Kube-proxy are the components that interact with k8s API in control plane via HTTPS.

Other components of a Node:
- Cgroupv2: based on linux cgroups
- Container Runtime: docker, runc?
